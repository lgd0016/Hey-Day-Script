# Hey Day Script
### Hey Day is a tradition at Auburn that was started after World War II when students who served in the war returned home. In an effort to promote a friendly atmosphere on campus, Hey Day was created so that every student could wear a name tag and say "hello" to everyone they saw. This was done in an effort to help all students feel a sense of belonging, especially those who had just returned home from WWII. The tradition was carried on and continues to be a day that Auburn students look forward to!
